Prompt Styles:

Prompt Without Shots (Zero-Shot Prompting)

Prompt With Shots (OpenAI Style)

Prompt With Shots in Sample Section Style


Zero-Shot: Prompting works well for simple or well-understood queries but struggles with accuracy in more complex cases.
Without any guidance, GPT is prone to generating incomplete or incorrect SQL queries.

OpenAI Style (With Shots): provides a strong improvement in accuracy by using examples,
but it can lead to overfitting, especially for more unique or nuanced questions.
It's effective for standard queries but less adaptable for novel scenarios.

Sample Section Style: strikes a balance between structure and flexibility. 
It provides clear examples without constraining GPT too much, making it highly effective for both standard and more complex queries.
This method is particularly suitable for educational environments and real-world use where adaptability is important.



- Prompts with shots drastically reduce the chance of SQL mistakes or hallucinated table names.

- When using Spanish questions (or non-English languages), the shots-based prompts still work well as long as the examples remain in English â€” GPT understands the switch.

- The Sample Section style is great for educational contexts, while OpenAI-style shots are more natural for chat-like systems.

- Always testing with a question in another language (Spanish in this case) confirmed the importance of samples for guiding structure rather than language.
